  <a href="hoobies.html" target="_blank">My Hoobies</a>
  <h3><em>Some Details About My Goal</em></h3>
  <p>For becoming the <strong>StrongestManAlive</strong> I have to make my all asects strong that are -: <br>
  <ul>
     <li><em><strong>Physically Strong</strong></em></li>
     <li><em><strong>Mentally Strong</strong></em></li>
     <li><em><strong>Financially Strong</strong></em></li>
   </ul>
 </p>
   <h3><em>Some Detail</em></h3>
  <p>Lets discuss my goals in some depth. <br>
     Motivation, Support and all are good things for keep going in the path you want to go, but in my perception the most important thing is being <strong><em>DECIPLINED</em></strong>, it is the key to achieve your goals. <br>
   There are many thing I use as mmotivations but being decipline is a choice that you have to make if you want to succeed.
  <ul>
    <li>Starting with <u><em>Physical Strength</em></u>, I go to gym 6 times a week where I follow a training plan, a plan is very important for achieving your goals and you have to change you plans time to time according to situations.
      You have keep track of your progress, here is a site you can check your ability level <strong><em><a href="https://strengthlevel.com" target="_blank"><button>StrengthLevel</button></a></em></strong> and I take a maintained diet which helps me in my recovery and muscle recovery. </li>
  </ul>
